## Usage
Use the FixedStruct<Q\> with the required Q value (New Q values can be created as needed in the same format as the original ones) to obtain an instance of the fixed arithmetic number.

Self explanatory methods such as .Add, .Subtract, .Abs are provided as well as standard overloaded operators.

Usage of the module can more clearly be seen in its tests and benchmark.
